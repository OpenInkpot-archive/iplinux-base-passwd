Description: Slind base system master password and group files
 These are the canonical master copies of the user database files
 (/etc/passwd and /etc/group), containing the Slind/Debian-allocated user and
 group IDs. The update-passwd tool is provided to keep the system databases
 synchronized with these master files.
